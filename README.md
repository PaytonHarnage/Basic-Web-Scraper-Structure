# Basic-Web-Scraper-Structure
This project is a Python-based web scraper designed with a focus on security. It gathers and analyzes publicly available data from websites, looking for potential security risks and vulnerabilities. The scraper checks for various issues, including exposed email addresses, insecure HTTP connections, and potential directory exposures

# Key Features
* Email Detection: Scans the webpage for exposed email addresses, which could be targeted by spammers or phishing attacks
* SSL/TLS Verification: Checks if the website uses HTTPS to ensure secure communication and data transmission.
* Sensitive Directory Detection: Searches the robots.txt file for potentially exposed directories such as /admin/ or /backup/.
* Internal Link Crawling: Crawls through internal links to gather data from multiple pages within the site.
* User-Friendly: Provides easy-to-understand results about the security posture of the website.

# Technologies Used
* Python: Core language for scraping and processing data
* BeautifulSoup & Requests: For parsing HTML and HTTP requests
* Regex: For detecting email addresses and other patterns in the page content
* SSL/TLS: For verifying secure HHTPS connections

# Future Improvements: 
* Extend security checks to include known vulnerabilities using external APIs
* Integrate machine learning to detect suspicious patterns across large datasets
* Support for dynamic, JavaScript-heavy websites using tools Selenium
